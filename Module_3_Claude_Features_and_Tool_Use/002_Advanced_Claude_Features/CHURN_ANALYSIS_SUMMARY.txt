================================================================================
KEY INSIGHTS
================================================================================

1. ENGAGEMENT IS EVERYTHING
   Low engagement (viewing hours, session length, content variety) is the
   primary churn driver. This is NOT a pricing problem—it's an engagement
   problem.

2. CUSTOMER SERVICE RED FLAG
   The only positive correlation with churn. More support calls = frustrated
   customers = higher churn. This is an early warning indicator.

3. BASIC TIER VULNERABILITY
   Nearly half of Basic tier customers churn. They need better value
   demonstration or feature access.

4. GENRE-SPECIFIC CONTENT GAPS
   Horror/Thriller fans churn at 2x the rate of Documentary fans. Content
   library weaknesses are evident.

5. EARLY INTERVENTION OPPORTUNITY
   Engagement metrics decline BEFORE churn. Proactive monitoring can prevent
   customer loss.

================================================================================
ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

IMMEDIATE (WEEK 1):
☐ Set up automated alerts for customers <70 viewing hours/month
☐ Flag all customers with 3+ customer service interactions
☐ Begin proactive outreach to high-risk segments

SHORT-TERM (MONTH 1-3):
☐ Improve content recommendation algorithms
☐ Launch re-engagement campaigns for low-engagement users
☐ Create genre-specific retention programs (especially Horror/Thriller)
☐ Offer proactive discounts to customers with recent service issues

MEDIUM-TERM (QUARTER 1-2):
☐ Enhance Basic tier value proposition
☐ Build predictive churn model for weekly risk scoring
☐ Improve content discovery features
☐ Reduce technical issues driving service calls

LONG-TERM (YEAR 1):
☐ Expand content library in high-churn genres
☐ Develop automated intervention workflows
☐ Optimize app performance and user experience
☐ Track and close content gaps vs. competitors
