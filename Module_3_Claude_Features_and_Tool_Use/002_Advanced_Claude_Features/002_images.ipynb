    "   - Distinction from other structures (garages, sheds, pools)\n",

    "   - Areas where branches create a \"bridge\" between wildland vegetation and the structure\n",

    "   - Rating 2 (Moderate Risk): Minimal overhang (<25% of roof), some separation between tree canopies\n",

Residence Identification:**\\nThe primary residence is a single-story structure with a light-colored (likely gray or tan) roof located in the center of the image, featuring an irregular footprint with multiple roof planes and what appears to be attached garage space on the eastern side.\\n\\n**2. Tree Overhang Analysis:**\\nMultiple large trees with dense canopies directly overhang substantial portions of the residence roof, with estimated coverage of 50-75% of the total roof area, particularly concentrated over the northern, eastern, and southern sections of the structure.\\n\\n**3. Fire Risk Assessment:**\\nThe overhanging trees create multiple ember catch points and establish direct fuel pathways from the surrounding dense forest canopy to the structure, with branches appearing to be in close proximity or direct contact with multiple roof sections, creating significant wildfire vulnerability.\\n\\n**4. Defensible Space Identification:**\\nThe property shows severely limited defensible space, with a continuous, dense tree canopy connecting the surrounding forest directly to and over the residence, creating dangerous fuel ladders and minimal vegetation clearance around the structure.\\n\\n**5. Fire Risk Rating:**\\n**Rating: 4 (Severe Risk)** - The property exhibits extensive tree overhang covering more than 50% of the roof, dense vegetation with minimal defensible space, continuous canopy connections between wildland vegetation and the structure, and numerous ember catch points, all of which create extreme wildfire vulnerability with limited options for structure defense.', type='text')], model='claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(cache_creation=CacheCreation(ephemeral_1h_input_tokens=0, ephemeral_5m_input_tokens=0), cache_creation_input_tokens=0, cache_read_input_tokens=0, input_tokens=2039, output_tokens=323, server_tool_use=None, service_tier='standard', inference_geo='not_available'))"
