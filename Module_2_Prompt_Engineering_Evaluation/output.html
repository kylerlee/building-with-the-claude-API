## Key Notes
✅ **Protein sources:** Varied plant-based proteins (legumes, tofu, nuts, seeds, grains) for complete amino acids  
✅ **Carbs strategically timed** around workout for energy and recovery  
✅ **Calorie balance** maintains current athletic performance without surplus or deficit  
✅ **B12 supplementation:** Take 1 vegan B12 supplement daily (2,000 mcg weekly or 25 mcg daily)  
✅ **Hydration:** Drink 3-4 liters of water daily  
✅ **Flexible:** Swap tofu for tempeh; rotate legumes (beans, lentils, peas); adjust portions ±100 cal based on training intensity</pre></td>
                <td class="score-col"><span class="score score-high">9</span></td>
                <td class="reasoning">The solution fully satisfies all mandatory requirements with clear daily calorie targets, detailed macronutrient percentages, and every meal specified with exact portions and timing. All foods are strictly vegan with excellent protein diversity suitable for athletic performance. The meal plan demonstrates strong nutritional knowledge with strategic carb/protein timing around workouts and appropriate supplementation guidance. Secondary criteria are largely met with only minor issues: a negligible calorie math discrepancy and lack of sport-specific customization (though the task didn't require this). The plan is compact, concise, and practical as requested.</td>

## Key Notes
✅ **Protein distribution:** 2.0g per kg bodyweight supports maximum muscle synthesis  
✅ **Carbs timed strategically** around workout for energy and recovery  
✅ **Calorie surplus:** ~400-500 kcal above maintenance drives muscle growth  
✅ **Hydration:** Aim for 3-4 liters of water daily  
✅ **Flexibility:** Substitute chicken for turkey, fish, or salmon; adjust portions ±100 cal based on weekly progress  
✅ **No restrictions:** All foods included; choose based on preference and availability</pre></td>

                <td class="reasoning">The solution meets all three mandatory requirements comprehensively: it provides daily calorie count (3,200 kcal), detailed macronutrient breakdown (170g protein, 400g carbs, 107g fat), and meals with exact portions, timing, and food items. It exceeds the protein requirement at 2.0g/kg bodyweight and includes strategically timed pre/post-workout meals with appropriate macronutrient ratios. However, the meal structure violates the secondary criterion of 4-5 meals distributed throughout the day by including 7 distinct eating occasions. While the optional designation of the evening snack provides some flexibility, the core plan still presents 6 mandatory meals, which exceeds the specified range. This is a clear deviation from the stated criteria, though it does not violate mandatory requirements.</td>

## Key Notes
✅ **Carbohydrate emphasis** (60% of calories) supports glycogen storage for endurance  
✅ **Moderate protein** (1.6g/kg) adequate for recovery without excess bulk  
✅ **Simple carbs timed** around training for optimal energy and recovery  
✅ **Low fiber pre-run** to prevent GI distress during long runs  
✅ **Hydration:** Drink 3-4 liters of water daily + electrolyte drinks during long runs  
✅ **Flexible:** Swap pasta for rice/potatoes; salmon for chicken; adjust based on run distance</pre></td>

                <td class="reasoning">The solution meets all three mandatory requirements: it includes daily calorie count (3,400 kcal stated), macronutrient breakdown, and meals with exact timing and portions. It also satisfies both secondary criteria with strategically timed carbs around training and a compact, concise format. However, there is a significant mathematical discrepancy—the actual meal totals (3,980 kcal) substantially exceed the stated target (3,400 kcal), and the macronutrient percentages don't match the actual composition. This inconsistency suggests either a calculation error or misalignment between targets and execution. Despite this flaw, the solution is functionally complete and would serve an athlete well; the error appears to be in the stated targets rather than the meal design itself. The plan is well-structured, practical, and appropriately tailored for marathon training with carbohydrate loading.</td>
