    "reasoning": "The solution fails to meet all three mandatory requirements. While it provides macronutrient percentages and general meal structure, it lacks: (1) a specific daily calorie count for the sample day, (2) exact portion sizes for meals (critical omission), and (3) specific meal timing. The solution reads more as a framework/template rather than a concrete 1-day meal plan. Without portion sizes, it's impossible to verify the plan actually totals 3000+ calories or meets the 55-65% carbohydrate target. The hydration guidance is generic rather than strategically timed around specific meals and training."

    "reasoning": "The solution fails to meet the mandatory requirement of providing 'meals with exact food, timing and portion sizes.' While it successfully delivers daily calorie count and macronutrient breakdown, it is fundamentally a nutritional framework and food reference guide rather than an actual 1-day meal plan. The task explicitly requests a 'compact, concise 1 day meal plan' with specific meals, but the solution only provides categories and recommendations without concrete meal examples. For example, it should show: 'Breakfast (7am): 3 eggs + 1 cup oats + banana = 45g protein, 60g carbs, 15g fat' for each meal throughout the day. The solution ends by asking if the user wants a sample meal plan, indicating the actual meal plan was not provided."
