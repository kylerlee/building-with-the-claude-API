    "reasoning": "The solution fully satisfies all mandatory requirements with clear daily calorie targets, detailed macronutrient percentages, and every meal specified with exact portions and timing. All foods are strictly vegan with excellent protein diversity suitable for athletic performance. The meal plan demonstrates strong nutritional knowledge with strategic carb/protein timing around workouts and appropriate supplementation guidance. Secondary criteria are largely met with only minor issues: a negligible calorie math discrepancy and lack of sport-specific customization (though the task didn't require this). The plan is compact, concise, and practical as requested."

It exceeds the protein requirement at 2.0g/kg bodyweight and includes strategically timed pre/post-workout meals with appropriate macronutrient ratios. However, the meal structure violates the secondary criterion of 4-5 meals distributed throughout the day by including 7 distinct eating occasions. While the optional designation of the evening snack provides some flexibility, the core plan still presents 6 mandatory meals, which exceeds the specified range. This is a clear deviation from the stated criteria, though it does not violate mandatory requirements."

However, there is a significant mathematical discrepancy\u2014the actual meal totals (3,980 kcal) substantially exceed the stated target (3,400 kcal), and the macronutrient percentages don't match the actual composition. This inconsistency suggests either a calculation error or misalignment between targets and execution.
